5. Did you add a bonus feature to your submission? If so, what is it and how should we see it?
    We did not add any bonus features.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    I think my NPM version is slightly different so toPromise is already deprecated and I cannot use it
    Instead, I returned using 'lastValueFrom.' It works for mine and I finished the entire project with that,
    my partner could not get lastValueFrom to work correctly so she had to use toPromise. We are submitting mine,
    so hopefully it will be able to work on other versions.

    This is my exact npm version: {
    npm: '8.1.2',
    node: '16.13.2',
    v8: '9.4.146.24-node.14',
    uv: '1.42.0',
    zlib: '1.2.11',
    brotli: '1.0.9',
    ares: '1.18.1',
    modules: '93',
    nghttp2: '1.45.1',
    napi: '8',
    llhttp: '6.0.4',
    openssl: '1.1.1l+quic',
    cldr: '39.0',
    icu: '69.1',
    tz: '2021a',
    unicode: '13.0',
    ngtcp2: '0.1.0-DEV',
    nghttp3: '0.1.0-DEV'
    }
